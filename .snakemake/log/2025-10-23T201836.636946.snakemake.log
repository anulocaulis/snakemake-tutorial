MissingOutputException in rule samtools_sort in file "/mnt/c/Users/Mike/Downloads/thesis_workspace/snakemake-tutorial/Snakefile", line 20:
Job 4  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
sorted_reads/B.bam (missing locally, parent dir contents: )
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look below for error messages
